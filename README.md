## Getting Started

The first thing you need to do is add environment variables to `.env.local` (you can find an example in `.env.example` )

Then you have to open the official website Spotify, go to your account, and start any track, then pause it. (Unfortunately this is how the Spotify API works)

After that, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
